This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic German board game Mensch Ã¤rgere dich nicht ("Don't Get Angry"), developed using Tkinter for the GUI. It faithfully recreates the original gameplay with support for multiple players, dice rolling mechanics, turn-based movement, and collision rules for kicking opponents back to base. The project showcases structured game logic, user interaction handling, and dynamic visual updatesâ€”all within Pythonâ€™s standard library, making it lightweight and easy to run across platforms.
